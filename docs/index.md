# Mapzen Android SDK

The Mapzen Android SDK is a thin wrapper that packages up everything you need to use Mapzen services in your Android applications. It also simplify setup, installation, API key management and generally make your life better.

## Current functionality:
Currently the Mapzen SDK supports map rendering, location tracking, turn-by-turn directions, and search/geocoding through the following projects:

- [L.O.S.T](https://github.com/mapzen/lost)- Our drop-in replacement for Google Play Services Location APIs
- [Tangram](https://github.com/tangrams/tangram-es/)- Our 2D and 3D map renderer using OpenGL ES
- [On the road](https://github.com/mapzen/on-the-road)- The Mapzen Turn-by-Turn wrapper and other routing utilities.
- [Pelias](https://github.com/pelias/pelias-android-sdk)- The Mapzen Search wrapper
